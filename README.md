# FIREMaster

A self-hosted FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) planning cockpit. Your real accounts, your real spending, your real
retirement math — running on your own machine, with an AI analyst that can read all of it.

FIREMaster answers the questions generic retirement calculators can't:

- *I just left my job at 52. Does the bridge to 59½ actually hold?*
- *What happens if I sell the rental in 18 months instead of carrying it?*
- *Where does cash run out — and which lever (spending, a property sale, a 72(t) plan) fixes it?*
- *What did this property really cost me last year, all-in?*

It does this with month-by-month wealth-pool projections (cash, taxable, IRAs, real estate,
private equity — each with its own rules), scenario comparison, SEPP/72(t) bridge modeling,
per-property P&L, and a spending tracker — all driven by data that syncs automatically from
your real accounts.

> **Not financial advice.** FIREMaster is a modeling tool you run yourself. Sanity-check the
> assumptions, and make decisions with a professional where it matters.

## The two-interface architecture

FIREMaster is deliberately built as two layers (see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)):

1. **The cockpit** — a React dashboard for entering your plan and seeing state at a glance:
   net worth, runway, projections, properties, spending.
2. **The copilot** — every number in the app is served by a local FastAPI backend
   (`http://localhost:8000/docs`). Point [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code) at it
   and you have a financial analyst with full access to *your* data: ad-hoc questions,
   scenario stress-tests, spending audits, tax-year prep. This is the feature the dashboard
   is just the front end for. See [docs/CLAUDE_CODE_USAGE.md](docs/CLAUDE_CODE_USAGE.md).

## Monarch by design

FIREMaster does **not** connect to your banks. [Monarch Money](https://www.monarchmoney.com)
(~$8/month) owns aggregation — bank connections, transaction dedup, merchant cleanup,
categories — because that's a hard, thankless problem that a dedicated product already solves
well. FIREMaster syncs from Monarch and owns everything Monarch doesn't: FIRE projections,
scenario math, property P&L, bridge planning, and the AI-analyst layer.

This is a deliberate two-layer architecture, not a missing feature. It also means you don't
need Monarch to try the app:

- **Day one (no Monarch):** seed the built-in demo persona and every page renders alive —
  a 52-year-old fresh off a layoff, three properties, a SEPP bridge plan, and a cash crunch
  the projections catch before it happens.
- **When you're ready:** connect your Monarch account and sync your real data. Your first
  sync automatically clears the demo persona — no manual cleanup needed.

## Quick start

Prerequisites: **[Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)** and the
**[GitHub CLI (`gh`)](https://cli.github.com/)**. For the full AI-analyst experience (the
reason this app exists), add **[Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code)** with a
[Pro or Max](https://claude.ai/) subscription — see
[docs/CLAUDE_CODE_USAGE.md](docs/CLAUDE_CODE_USAGE.md). No Python, Node, or shell tooling on
your machine. Works on macOS, Windows, and Linux. (On Windows, Docker Desktop installs WSL2
itself — one reboot, then the commands below.)

```bash
gh auth login                                         # GitHub.com → HTTPS → browser (paste the code shown in terminal)
gh repo clone ngonz/fire-master-fork firemaster && cd firemaster

docker compose run --rm --no-deps setup   # one-time: JWT secret, admin password, random DB/Redis passwords
docker compose up --build                             # builds + starts everything; migrations + demo data load automatically
```

> **`--no-deps` on the setup line is not optional.** Setup only writes files, so it needs no
> services — but without `--no-deps`, Compose helpfully starts Postgres *first*, before any
> password exists. Postgres then permanently bakes the `CHANGEME-run-app-setup` placeholder into
> its data volume, and every later connection is rejected. If you already hit this, run
> `docker compose down -v` once (safe on a fresh install — there is nothing to lose yet) and then
> `docker compose up --build`.

Open **http://localhost:5173** and log in as `admin` with the password you chose — the **demo
persona is already loaded**, so every page (Dashboard, Retirement, Runway, Config) is alive on
first launch.

> **Everything binds to `127.0.0.1` by default** — the database, cache, API and UI are reachable
> from this machine only. This is deliberate: the app holds your full Monarch transaction history,
> and Postgres/Redis sit *behind* the login screen, so exposing them would hand out the data
> without ever touching the JWT. To share on your LAN, set `BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0` in the root `.env`
> — but put real authentication in front of it first.
>
> **`--build` builds from this checkout**, so you run the code you can actually read. To pull
> prebuilt images instead, set `FIREMASTER_BACKEND_IMAGE` / `FIREMASTER_FRONTEND_IMAGE` in the
> root `.env`. Be aware a `:latest` tag is mutable and will not contain any local changes.
> A `migrate` container that shows `Exited (0)` is normal — it applied migrations + seeded the demo, then quit.
> If `:5432`/`:6379`/`:8000`/`:5173` are already taken, set e.g.
> `BACKEND_HOST_PORT=8001 FRONTEND_HOST_PORT=5174` before the command. Operational details,
> and how to undo any of this, are in [docs/CONTAINER_RUNBOOK.md](docs/CONTAINER_RUNBOOK.md).

The demo seeds automatically on a fresh database — to start **blank** instead, run
`SEED_DEMO=false docker compose up`. Optional extras, in a second terminal:

```bash
docker compose exec backend uv run python ../scripts/seed_scenarios.py   # example what-if scenarios
```

The demo is safe to explore or re-seed, and **clears itself on your first real Monarch sync**
(or `seed_demo.py --remove` any time).

### Going live with your data

```bash
docker compose exec backend uv run python ../scripts/monarch_login.py    # one-time Monarch auth (email/password/MFA)
```

Then hit **Sync Now** on the Dashboard — your first sync **auto-clears the demo persona**,
leaving just your data (rebuild your plan under **Settings → Plan** in the sidebar). Full walkthrough — including
account enrichment, property rules, and your first FIRE config — in
[docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md](docs/SETUP_GUIDE.md) and [docs/MONARCH_SETUP.md](docs/MONARCH_SETUP.md).

### Contributor / native dev (optional)

Prefer to run the backend and frontend **directly on your machine** for fast hot-reload? That
path still exists. It needs [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and Node 18+ in addition to Docker
(which still provides Postgres/Redis), and a bash shell (macOS/Linux/WSL2):

```bash
./scripts/setup.sh      # bash: generates backend/.env (JWT secret + admin password)
./scripts/start.sh      # postgres+redis in Docker; backend, worker, frontend on the host
```

Both paths share the same database, so you can switch between them freely.

## What's inside

| Page | What it does |
|---|---|
| Dashboard | Net worth, asset/liability allocation, history, one-click Monarch sync |
| Runway | Cash runway: months of burn covered, income vs. spend, upcoming cashflow events |
| Retirement | Wealth-pool projection to age 90+, scenario compare, SEPP bridge, FIRE number |
| Assets | Asset hub with enrichment: FIRE roles, strategies, notes per account |
| Spending | Spending analyzer by category/merchant over time |
| Tracker | Monthly non-property spending vs. target, category drill-down |
| Transactions | Full ledger browser: filter, classify, assign to properties |
| Properties | Per-property P&L from real transactions (rules + overrides + Monarch tags) |
| Tax Planning | Effective tax modeling for retirement drawdown *(early development — disabled in current release)* |

Under the hood: Python 3.12 / FastAPI / SQLAlchemy 2.0 async / PostgreSQL 16 / Celery + Redis,
React 18 + TypeScript / Vite / Tailwind. All money is integer cents; all projections are in
today's dollars. The test suite covers the projection engine, tax math, scenario merging, and property
classification (`docker compose exec backend uv run pytest`, or `cd backend && uv run pytest`
on the native path).

## Troubleshooting

- **`Docker daemon is not running`** — start Docker Desktop first and wait for it to finish launching.
- **Port already in use** — the stack publishes 5432, 6379, 8000, 5173 on `127.0.0.1`. Remap any of
  them with the `POSTGRES_HOST_PORT` / `REDIS_HOST_PORT` / `BACKEND_HOST_PORT` / `FRONTEND_HOST_PORT`
  env vars, e.g. `BACKEND_HOST_PORT=8001 docker compose up`. The bind interface is separate
  (`BIND_HOST`) so remapping a port can't accidentally drop the loopback restriction.
- **Can't reach the app from another device** — that's the default. Set `BIND_HOST=0.0.0.0` in the
  root `.env` and restart. Everything on that network can then reach Postgres and Redis directly,
  which bypasses the login entirely, so only do this on a network you trust.
- **`password authentication failed for user "firemaster"`** — Postgres only applies
  `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` when it initialises an *empty* data directory. If you changed the password
  after the first run, the volume still has the old one. Either `docker compose down -v` (this
  destroys the database) or change it in place: `docker compose exec postgres psql -U firemaster -c
  "ALTER USER firemaster PASSWORD '...';"`.
- **`migrate` container shows `Exited (0)`** — that's normal; it ran migrations and quit. See
  [docs/CONTAINER_RUNBOOK.md](docs/CONTAINER_RUNBOOK.md) for the full container troubleshooting table.
- **Login fails with a startup error about `JWT_SECRET_KEY`/`AUTH_PASSWORD_HASH`** — you skipped
  first-run setup: `docker compose run --rm --no-deps setup`.
- **Services start but can't reach Postgres/Redis, and the password looks like `CHANGEME-run-app-setup`**
  — you skipped first-run setup. That placeholder is the deliberate fallback so an unconfigured
  stack fails loudly instead of running on a guessable password.
- **Changed `backend/.env` but nothing happened** — settings are cached at process start;
  `docker compose restart backend celery-worker` (or restart the host processes on the native path).
- **Edited engine code but Celery behaves old** — the worker doesn't hot-reload;
  `docker compose restart celery-worker`.
- **Stack was offline for weeks** — incremental sync looks back 45 days. For longer gaps, run a
  backfill: see "Monarch sync" in [docs/MONARCH_SETUP.md](docs/MONARCH_SETUP.md).

## Why this exists

I spent twenty-five years building technology for movies, e-commerce, and games — the kind of career you don't plan an early exit from, until a layoff plans it for you. At 53, with a household that
runs on real estate as much as index funds, every retirement calculator I tried gave me a
polite shrug: none of them could model a severance runway, a 72(t) bridge, a rental that pays
for itself, or the one question that actually mattered — *which year does cash go negative,
and what fixes it?* So I built the tool I needed, on top of the data I already had. FIREMaster
is that tool, cleaned up so you can run it on yours.
